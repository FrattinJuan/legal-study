- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS framework used to design fast, responsive user interfaces with highly configurable utility classes.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that allows for more structured and efficient styling.
- **Ant Design**: A React UI component library used to create professional and consistent user interfaces.

## Project Structure

- **/public**: Contains static files that are served directly, such as images and favicons.
